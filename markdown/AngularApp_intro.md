Dependency Injection
--------------------

* Using this, custom modules can be injected just like adding assemblies on the server side code. This makes life little easier design MVC/MVVM based projects with separation of concern, modularity etc. An Analogy to server side code is represented below

HTML Templating
---------------

* Over the past few years, Single Page App’s (SPA’s) are gaining of a lot of traction from front end developers and end users. HTML templating feature in Angular makes it possible to easily switch the HTML in SPA’s.

> ##### TwoWay Binding

* Fellow Silverlight developers can understand the complexity of two-way binding using propertychange events back in the old days. But AngularJS databinding makes this right OOB.


> ##### Community Support

* Google continues to develop and maintain the library. Large community of developers has embraced the framework so ample support is available on Stackoverflow and AngularJS official site.

> ##### Error Handling

* Troubleshooting and error handling JS apps is pain. AngularJS apps can be configured with Logging and Error handling capabilities.
